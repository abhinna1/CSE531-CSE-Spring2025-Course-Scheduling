abhinna1: This table.html file has a list of different courses offerred in Spring 2025. I want you to accurately populate all the information in a csv file.

Workspace: Sure, here is the file you requested:[CSE_Graduate_Program_Class_Schedule_Spring_2025.csv](command:github.copilot.openFile?%5B%7B%22value%22%3A%5B%7B%22name%22%3A%22CSE_Graduate_Program_Class_Schedule_Spring_2025.csv%22%7D%5D%2C%22baseUri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FCSE_Graduate_Program_Class_Schedule_Spring_2025.csv%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22vscode-copilot-file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22dd5a150c-28e7-4d78-908c-bf099a74dd71%22%7D%7D%5D)

abhinna1: The "Times" Column. Have a look into that. Let me know how can we change it into something more processable, in a date-time format. Lets maybe create new columns called start time and end time.

GitHub Copilot: To convert the "Times" column into a more processable date-time format and create new columns for start time and end time, you can use the `pandas` library in Python. Here's how you can do it:

1. Split the "Times" column into start and end times.
2. Convert these times into a datetime format.

Here is an example code snippet to achieve this:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Assuming df is your DataFrame
# Sample data for demonstration
data = {
    "Times": ["12:30PM-1:50PM", "1:00PM-1:50PM", "4:00PM-4:50PM", "1:00PM-3:50PM", "5:00PM-7:50PM"]
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Function to convert time string to datetime.time object
def convert_to_time(time_str):
    return pd.to_datetime(time_str, format='%I:%M%p').time()

# Split the "Times" column into "Start Time" and "End Time"
df[['Start Time', 'End Time']] = df['Times'].str.split('-', expand=True)

# Convert the "Start Time" and "End Time" columns to datetime.time format
df['Start Time'] = df['Start Time'].apply(convert_to_time)
df['End Time'] = df['End Time'].apply(convert_to_time)

print(df)
```

This code will create new columns "Start Time" and "End Time" with the times in a more processable format. You can adjust the sample data to match your actual DataFrame.

abhinna1: def get_schedule(dataframe: pd.DataFrame):
    """
    # Constraints
    -  Course Days
    -  Course Timing

    # Algorithm
    -  Select the course with the earliest end time.
    -  Remove all other courses with

        start times < finish time 
        of the selected course.
    -  Remove all courses with Course == selected course.
    """

    This is the strategy I have come up with. You may verify this strategy in order to achieve the goal of scheduling maximum number of courses that can be taken without sheduling comflicts, i.e. time conflicts and course conflicts. example, Selecting course CSE 510 with Section AYY means we can now not select CSE 510 course with section ETH or just any other section of CSE 510. The time conflict is also relative to the Days available. Days have unique values TR, MWF, R and MW which mean Tuesday & Thursday, Monday, Wednesday and Friday, Thursday & finally, Monday and Wednesday Respectively. Therefore, time conflict occurs only if two courses have conflicting start time and end time in the same Days not in different Days.

    Based on this information, verify the strategy thoroughly.

    Don't jump into the code right away, for now just analyze my strategy.

GitHub Copilot: Your strategy for scheduling the maximum number of courses without conflicts is well thought out. Let's break it down and verify each step:

1. **Constraints:**
   - **Course Days:** Courses are scheduled on specific days, represented by unique values such as TR, MWF, R, and MW.
   - **Course Timing:** Courses have specific start and end times.
   - **Course Section Uniqueness:** Each course section must be unique in the schedule.

2. **Algorithm:**
   - **Select the course with the earliest end time:** This is a classic greedy algorithm approach for interval scheduling. By always selecting the course that finishes the earliest, you maximize the remaining time available for other courses.
   - **Remove all other courses with the same day(s) and conflicting times:** This ensures that no two courses overlap in time on the same day(s).
   - **Remove all courses with the same course code:** This ensures that only one section of each course is selected.

3. **Days Representation:**
   - **TR:** Tuesday and Thursday
   - **MWF:** Monday, Wednesday, and Friday
   - **R:** Thursday
   - **MW:** Monday and Wednesday

4. **Time Conflict:**
   - Time conflicts occur only if two courses have overlapping times on the same days. For example, a course on TR from 10:00 AM to 11:20 AM conflicts with another course on TR from 11:00 AM to 12:20 PM but does not conflict with a course on MWF from 10:00 AM to 11:20 AM.

### Verification of Strategy:

- **Greedy Choice:** Selecting the course with the earliest end time is a valid greedy choice for interval scheduling problems. This choice ensures that the maximum number of non-overlapping intervals (courses) is selected.
- **Conflict Removal:** Removing courses with overlapping times on the same days and removing other sections of the same course ensures that no conflicts arise in the schedule.
- **Uniqueness:** Ensuring that each course section is unique in the schedule is a necessary constraint to avoid duplicate course entries.

### Conclusion:

Your strategy is sound and follows a well-known greedy algorithm approach for interval scheduling. It effectively handles both time conflicts and course conflicts, ensuring that the maximum number of non-overlapping courses is scheduled. You can proceed with implementing this strategy in code.

abhinna1: Sounds good, now lets get into the first step of finding the course witht he earliest end time.

GitHub Copilot: To find the course with the earliest end time, you can follow these steps:

1. Convert the "Times" column into start and end times.
2. Sort the DataFrame by the end times.

Here's how you can do it in code:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Sample data for demonstration
data = {
    "Course": ["CSE 510", "CSE 510", "CSE 510", "CSE 510", "CSE 518"],
    "Section": ["AYY", "ETH", "HIRS", "XION", "A"],
    "Days": ["TR", "MWF", "MWF", "R", "R"],
    "Times": ["12:30PM-1:50PM", "1:00PM-1:50PM", "4:00PM-4:50PM", "1:00PM-3:50PM", "5:00PM-7:50PM"]
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Function to convert time string to datetime.time object
def convert_to_time(time_str):
    return pd.to_datetime(time_str, format='%I:%M%p').time()

# Split the "Times" column into "Start Time" and "End Time"
df[['Start Time', 'End Time']] = df['Times'].str.split('-', expand=True)

# Convert the "Start Time" and "End Time" columns to datetime.time format
df['Start Time'] = df['Start Time'].apply(convert_to_time)
df['End Time'] = df['End Time'].apply(convert_to_time)

# Sort the DataFrame by "End Time"
df_sorted = df.sort_values(by='End Time')

# Get the course with the earliest end time
earliest_course = df_sorted.iloc[0]

print(earliest_course)
```

This code will:
1. Split the "Times" column into "Start Time" and "End Time".
2. Convert these times into a datetime format.
3. Sort the DataFrame by the "End Time" column.
4. Select the course with the earliest end time.

You can then use this sorted DataFrame to proceed with the next steps of your algorithm.

abhinna1: Yeah, I've already did the dtype conversions, you may look into the file once. Let's not write unnecessary code and variable definitions.

GitHub Copilot: Got it. Let's focus on finding the course with the earliest end time using the existing DataFrame. Assuming you have already converted the "Times" column into "Start Time" and "End Time" columns, we can proceed directly to sorting the DataFrame and selecting the course with the earliest end time.

Here's the code snippet to achieve this:

```python
# Sort the DataFrame by "End Time"
df_sorted = df.sort_values(by='End Time')

# Get the course with the earliest end time
earliest_course = df_sorted.iloc[0]

earliest_course
```

This code will:
1. Sort the DataFrame by the "End Time" column.
2. Select the course with the earliest end time.

You can then use this sorted DataFrame to proceed with the next steps of your algorithm.

abhinna1: seems good, we also have the Day constraint. So would it be ideal to deal with each day seperately?

GitHub Copilot: Yes, it would be ideal to deal with each day separately to ensure that there are no time conflicts within the same day. You can group the DataFrame by the "Days" column and then apply the scheduling algorithm to each group independently.

Here's how you can modify the `get_schedule` function to handle each day separately:

```python
import pandas as pd

def get_schedule(dataframe: pd.DataFrame):
    """
    # Constraints
    -  Course Days
    -  Course Timing
    -  Course Section has to be unique

    # Algorithm
    -  Select the course with the earliest end time.
    -  Remove all other courses with
        course day == day of selected &
        start times < finish time 
        of the selected course.
    -  Remove all courses with Course == selected course.
    """
    schedule = []

    # Group by "Days"
    grouped = dataframe.groupby('Days')

    for name, group in grouped:
        # Sort the group by "End Time"
        group_sorted = group.sort_values(by='End Time')

        while not group_sorted.empty:
            # Select the course with the earliest end time
            earliest_course = group_sorted.iloc[0]
            schedule.append(earliest_course)

            # Remove conflicting courses
            group_sorted = group_sorted[
                (group_sorted['Days'] != earliest_course['Days']) |
                (group_sorted['Start Time'] >= earliest_course['End Time']) |
                (group_sorted['Course'] != earliest_course['Course'])
            ]

    return pd.DataFrame(schedule)

# Assuming df is your DataFrame with the necessary columns
schedule_df = get_schedule(df)
print(schedule_df)
```

This code will:
1. Group the DataFrame by the "Days" column.
2. For each group, sort the courses by the "End Time".
3. Select the course with the earliest end time and add it to the schedule.
4. Remove conflicting courses (same days with overlapping times or same course).
5. Repeat until no more courses can be added to the schedule for that group.
6. Combine the results from all groups into a final schedule DataFrame.

This approach ensures that you handle each day's constraints separately and avoid time conflicts within the same day.

abhinna1: Hmm, but maybe since we have a function, we can implement this isolation based on the parameters? What I mean is that we call the function n times where n is the number of unique Days we have. Therefore, each call has only df of that particular day.

GitHub Copilot: Yes, you can definitely call the function multiple times, once for each unique set of days. This way, you can isolate the scheduling for each set of days. Here's how you can modify the `get_schedule` function to handle this:

```python
import pandas as pd

def get_schedule(dataframe: pd.DataFrame):
    """
    # Constraints
    -  Course Days
    -  Course Timing
    -  Course Section has to be unique

    # Algorithm
    -  Select the course with the earliest end time.
    -  Remove all other courses with
        course day == day of selected &
        start times < finish time 
        of the selected course.
    -  Remove all courses with Course == selected course.
    """
    schedule = []

    # Get unique days
    unique_days = dataframe['Days'].unique()

    for days in unique_days:
        # Filter the dataframe for the current set of days
        day_df = dataframe[dataframe['Days'] == days]

        # Sort the filtered dataframe by "End Time"
        day_df_sorted = day_df.sort_values(by='End Time')

        while not day_df_sorted.empty:
            # Select the course with the earliest end time
            earliest_course = day_df_sorted.iloc[0]
            schedule.append(earliest_course)

            # Remove conflicting courses
            day_df_sorted = day_df_sorted[
                (day_df_sorted['Start Time'] >= earliest_course['End Time']) |
                (day_df_sorted['Course'] != earliest_course['Course'])
            ]

    return pd.DataFrame(schedule)

# Assuming df is your DataFrame with the necessary columns
schedule_df = get_schedule(df)
print(schedule_df)
```

This code will:
1. Get the unique sets of days from the DataFrame.
2. For each set of days, filter the DataFrame to include only courses scheduled on those days.
3. Sort the filtered DataFrame by the "End Time".
4. Select the course with the earliest end time and add it to the schedule.
5. Remove conflicting courses (same days with overlapping times or same course).
6. Repeat until no more courses can be added to the schedule for that set of days.
7. Combine the results from all sets of days into a final schedule DataFrame.

This approach ensures that you handle each set of days separately and avoid time conflicts within the same set of days.

abhinna1: Alright you didn't get it exactly. Check the file and don't change the get_schedule function in any way for now. And just show me how I'd call it with an instance of data frame with unique Days values. Also don't use any loops write the function calls explicitly. the unique values are: ['TR', 'MWF', 'R', 'MW']

GitHub Copilot: Understood. You can call the `get_schedule` function explicitly for each unique set of days by filtering the DataFrame for each set of days and passing the filtered DataFrame to the function. Here's how you can do it:

```python
# Assuming df is your DataFrame with the necessary columns

# Unique days
unique_days = ['TR', 'MWF', 'R', 'MW']

# Filter the DataFrame for each unique set of days and call get_schedule
schedule_TR = get_schedule(df[df['Days'] == 'TR'])
schedule_MWF = get_schedule(df[df['Days'] == 'MWF'])
schedule_R = get_schedule(df[df['Days'] == 'R'])
schedule_MW = get_schedule(df[df['Days'] == 'MW'])

# Combine the results into a single DataFrame
final_schedule = pd.concat([schedule_TR, schedule_MWF, schedule_R, schedule_MW])

print(final_schedule)
```

This code will:
1. Filter the DataFrame for each unique set of days (`TR`, `MWF`, `R`, `MW`).
2. Call the `get_schedule` function for each filtered DataFrame.
3. Combine the results from all calls into a single DataFrame using `pd.concat`.

This way, you can handle each set of days separately without modifying the `get_schedule` function.

abhinna1: Ok there might be an issue with this, If we deal TR and R seperately, we may not handle the conflict in Thurdays right?

GitHub Copilot: You are correct. Handling `TR` and `R` separately would not account for conflicts on Thursdays. To address this, we need to ensure that courses scheduled on overlapping days are considered together. 

We can handle this by grouping the days into sets that do not overlap. For example, we can combine `TR` and `R` into a single group and handle `MWF` and `MW` separately.

Here's how you can do it:

```python
# Assuming df is your DataFrame with the necessary columns

# Group days into sets that do not overlap
days_groups = {
    'TR_R': ['TR', 'R'],
    'MWF': ['MWF'],
    'MW': ['MW']
}

# Filter the DataFrame for each group of days and call get_schedule
schedule_TR_R = get_schedule(df[df['Days'].isin(days_groups['TR_R'])])
schedule_MWF = get_schedule(df[df['Days'].isin(days_groups['MWF'])])
schedule_MW = get_schedule(df[df['Days'].isin(days_groups['MW'])])

# Combine the results into a single DataFrame
final_schedule = pd.concat([schedule_TR_R, schedule_MWF, schedule_MW])

print(final_schedule)
```

This code will:
1. Group the days into sets that do not overlap (`TR` and `R` together, `MWF` separately, and `MW` separately).
2. Filter the DataFrame for each group of days.
3. Call the `get_schedule` function for each filtered DataFrame.
4. Combine the results from all calls into a single DataFrame using `pd.concat`.

This approach ensures that conflicts on overlapping days (e.g., Thursdays) are handled correctly.

abhinna1: So you're suggesting we could just group TR and R in the same group?

GitHub Copilot: Yes, grouping `TR` and `R` together ensures that any conflicts on Thursdays are handled correctly. Here's how you can do it:

```python
# Assuming df is your DataFrame with the necessary columns

# Group days into sets that do not overlap
days_groups = {
    'TR_R': ['TR', 'R'],
    'MWF': ['MWF'],
    'MW': ['MW']
}

# Filter the DataFrame for each group of days and call get_schedule
schedule_TR_R = get_schedule(df[df['Days'].isin(days_groups['TR_R'])])
schedule_MWF = get_schedule(df[df['Days'].isin(days_groups['MWF'])])
schedule_MW = get_schedule(df[df['Days'].isin(days_groups['MW'])])

# Combine the results into a single DataFrame
final_schedule = pd.concat([schedule_TR_R, schedule_MWF, schedule_MW])

print(final_schedule)
```

This code will:
1. Group the days into sets that do not overlap (`TR` and `R` together, `MWF` separately, and `MW` separately).
2. Filter the DataFrame for each group of days.
3. Call the `get_schedule` function for each filtered DataFrame.
4. Combine the results from all calls into a single DataFrame using `pd.concat`.

This approach ensures that conflicts on overlapping days (e.g., Thursdays) are handled correctly.

abhinna1: Ok be critical on this one cause I may be wrong. If we group TR and R together, we would ignore any conflict in classes on Tuesday and Thurday right? like as a whole?

GitHub Copilot: You are correct. Grouping `TR` and `R` together would not properly handle conflicts between classes on Tuesday and Thursday. To accurately handle conflicts, we need to consider each day separately and then merge the results, ensuring that no conflicts arise.

Here's a revised approach:

1. Handle each unique set of days separately.
2. Merge the results while ensuring no conflicts.

Here's how you can do it:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Assuming df is your DataFrame with the necessary columns

# Unique days
unique_days = ['TR', 'MWF', 'R', 'MW']

# Filter the DataFrame for each unique set of days and call get_schedule
schedule_TR = get_schedule(df[df['Days'] == 'TR'])
schedule_MWF = get_schedule(df[df['Days'] == 'MWF'])
schedule_R = get_schedule(df[df['Days'] == 'R'])
schedule_MW = get_schedule(df[df['Days'] == 'MW'])

# Combine the results into a single DataFrame
combined_schedule = pd.concat([schedule_TR, schedule_MWF, schedule_R, schedule_MW])

# Ensure no conflicts in the combined schedule
final_schedule = combined_schedule.drop_duplicates(subset=['Course', 'Section'])

print(final_schedule)
```

This code will:
1. Filter the DataFrame for each unique set of days (`TR`, `MWF`, `R`, `MW`).
2. Call the `get_schedule` function for each filtered DataFrame.
3. Combine the results from all calls into a single DataFrame using `pd.concat`.
4. Ensure no conflicts in the combined schedule by dropping duplicates based on the `Course` and `Section` columns.

This approach ensures that conflicts on overlapping days (e.g., Tuesdays and Thursdays) are handled correctly.

abhinna1: Here's my analysis.

Let's assume that we have 2 courses. course 1 is on Days TR and ends in 12:00:AM and course 2 is in Days R only and ends in 10:00 AM.

Let's say we have two options in how we can schedule our courses.

Strategy 1:
We group the TR and R courses in one set and process it in the function. When we do this however, we would choose course 2. But if we were to think optimally, choosing course 1 miight be better here, as its scheduled for 2 days while course 2 is only scheduled for 1 day i.e. thursday. This way, we get an optimal solution for Thurday but not for Tuesday.

Strategy 2:
We modify the dataset such that we have rows for each day. so for TR, we would have two different rows and we wouuld have a new column called day and that would be Tuesday and Thurdsay. This way, we would be finding the optimal course schedule for each day. However, the downside of this strategy would be that we would be decoupling the Days column we initially have. We can't do this becuase for the same example, we would be choosing course 1 for tuesday and course 2 for thursday. This isn't allowed.

Think critically, don't get to coding right now. Analyze which strategy would be better?

GitHub Copilot: Your analysis is thorough and highlights the complexities involved in scheduling courses optimally. Let's break down the two strategies you proposed:

### Strategy 1: Grouping TR and R Together

**Pros:**
- Ensures that conflicts on overlapping days (e.g., Thursdays) are handled correctly.
- Maintains the integrity of the original "Days" column.

**Cons:**
- May not always yield the optimal solution for each individual day. For example, a course scheduled on both Tuesday and Thursday might be overlooked in favor of a course scheduled only on Thursday if the latter has an earlier end time.

### Strategy 2: Decoupling Days into Individual Rows

**Pros:**
- Allows for optimal scheduling for each individual day.
- Ensures that each day is considered independently, which can lead to better utilization of available time slots.

**Cons:**
- Decouples the original "Days" column, which can lead to selecting courses that are not allowed (e.g., selecting a course on Tuesday and a different course on Thursday when they are supposed to be the same course).

### Critical Analysis

**Strategy 1** is more aligned with the constraints of the problem, as it maintains the integrity of the original "Days" column and ensures that courses scheduled on overlapping days are considered together. However, it may not always yield the optimal solution for each individual day.

**Strategy 2** offers a more granular approach, allowing for optimal scheduling for each individual day. However, it violates the constraint that courses scheduled on multiple days (e.g., TR) must be considered as a single entity.

Given the constraints and the need to maintain the integrity of the original "Days" column, **Strategy 1** is the better approach. It ensures that courses scheduled on overlapping days are considered together and avoids the issue of decoupling the "Days" column.

To address the potential suboptimality of Strategy 1, you can enhance the algorithm by considering the number of days a course is scheduled for when making scheduling decisions. For example, you can prioritize courses that are scheduled for more days (e.g., TR) over courses scheduled for fewer days (e.g., R) when their end times are close.

### Enhanced Strategy 1

1. Group the days into sets that do not overlap (e.g., TR and R together).
2. Within each group, prioritize courses that are scheduled for more days.
3. Sort the courses by end time within each priority group.
4. Select the course with the earliest end time, considering the priority.

This approach ensures that you handle overlapping days correctly while also considering the number of days a course is scheduled for, leading to a more optimal solution.

Would you like to proceed with implementing this enhanced Strategy 1?

abhinna1: If our goal is just to schedule the maximum number of courses, would choosing either have any significance to our final goal?

GitHub Copilot: If the primary goal is to schedule the maximum number of courses without conflicts, the choice between the two strategies may not significantly impact the final outcome. Both strategies aim to maximize the number of non-overlapping courses, but they approach the problem differently.

### Strategy 1: Grouping TR and R Together

- **Approach:** Considers overlapping days together, ensuring no conflicts on those days.
- **Outcome:** May prioritize courses differently based on end times, but still aims to maximize the number of non-overlapping courses.

### Strategy 2: Decoupling Days into Individual Rows

- **Approach:** Considers each day independently, potentially leading to more granular scheduling.
- **Outcome:** May result in selecting courses that are not allowed due to decoupling, but still aims to maximize the number of non-overlapping courses.

### Key Considerations

- **Integrity of Days:** Strategy 1 maintains the integrity of the original "Days" column, ensuring that courses scheduled on multiple days are considered as a single entity.
- **Granularity:** Strategy 2 offers more granular scheduling but may violate constraints by decoupling the "Days" column.

### Conclusion

If the goal is purely to maximize the number of courses without conflicts, both strategies can achieve this goal. However, Strategy 1 is more aligned with the constraints of the problem and ensures that courses scheduled on multiple days are considered together. This approach avoids potential issues with decoupling and maintains the integrity of the original schedule.

Therefore, **Strategy 1** is recommended as it balances the goal of maximizing the number of courses with the need to adhere to the constraints of the problem. It ensures that overlapping days are handled correctly and maintains the integrity of the original "Days" column.

Would you like to proceed with implementing Strategy 1, or do you have any further considerations?

abhinna1: @ Great, now let's move forward. Check the file and see. We have so far sorted the courses based on their end time. Now, let's get to the next step and remove courses with start times < finish time of the selected course. and we want to return the list of scheduled courses.

For now let's just get into the first iteration, no loops nothing.

look into the file


GitHub Copilot: Sure, let's proceed with the first iteration of the scheduling algorithm. We'll select the course with the earliest end time, remove conflicting courses, and return the list of scheduled courses for this iteration.

Here's how you can do it:

1. Sort the DataFrame by the "End Time" column.
2. Select the course with the earliest end time.
3. Remove conflicting courses (same days with overlapping times or same course).
4. Return the list of scheduled courses for this iteration.

Let's implement this in your main.ipynb file:

```python
# Assuming df is your DataFrame with the necessary columns

# Sort the DataFrame by "End Time"
df_sorted = df.sort_values(by='End Time')

# Select the course with the earliest end time
earliest_course = df_sorted.iloc[0]

# Remove conflicting courses
remaining_courses = df_sorted[
    (df_sorted['Days'] != earliest_course['Days']) |
    (df_sorted['Start Time'] >= earliest_course['End Time']) |
    (df_sorted['Course'] != earliest_course['Course'])
]

# Return the list of scheduled courses for this iteration
scheduled_courses = [earliest_course]

# Display the results
print("Earliest Course Selected:")
print(earliest_course)
print("\nRemaining Courses After Removing Conflicts:")
print(remaining_courses)
```

This code will:
1. Sort the DataFrame by the "End Time" column.
2. Select the course with the earliest end time.
3. Remove conflicting courses based on the same days with overlapping times or the same course.
4. Return the list of scheduled courses for this iteration.

You can then proceed with further iterations by repeating this process until no more courses can be added to the schedule.

abhinna1: ok next step, how do i make comparision such that list jobs with start time < finish time of sheduled course.

GitHub Copilot: To remove courses with start times that are less than the finish time of the selected course, you can use a comparison operation on the DataFrame. Here's how you can do it:

1. Select the course with the earliest end time.
2. Remove courses that have start times less than the end time of the selected course and are on the same days.

Let's implement this in your main.ipynb file:

```python
# Assuming df is your DataFrame with the necessary columns

# Sort the DataFrame by "End Time"
df_sorted = df.sort_values(by='End Time')

# Select the course with the earliest end time
earliest_course = df_sorted.iloc[0]

# Remove conflicting courses
remaining_courses = df_sorted[
    (df_sorted['Days'] != earliest_course['Days']) |
    (df_sorted['Start Time'] >= earliest_course['End Time']) |
    (df_sorted['Course'] != earliest_course['Course'])
]

# Return the list of scheduled courses for this iteration
scheduled_courses = [earliest_course]

# Display the results
print("Earliest Course Selected:")
print(earliest_course)
print("\nRemaining Courses After Removing Conflicts:")
print(remaining_courses)
```

This code will:
1. Sort the DataFrame by the "End Time" column.
2. Select the course with the earliest end time.
3. Remove conflicting courses based on the same days with overlapping times or the same course.
4. Return the list of scheduled courses for this iteration.

You can then proceed with further iterations by repeating this process until no more courses can be added to the schedule.

abhinna1: Can you create a gantt chart for this schedule?

GitHub Copilot: Sure, I can help you create a Gantt chart for the schedule using Python and the `plotly` library. Here's how you can do it:

1. Install the `plotly` library if you haven't already:
   ```bash
   pip install plotly
   ```

2. Use the following code to create a Gantt chart from the provided CSV file:

```python
import pandas as pd
import plotly.express as px

# Load the CSV file into a DataFrame
df = pd.read_csv('/home/abhinna/ub/Algorithms/HW2/generated_schedule.csv')

# Convert the "Start Time" and "End Time" columns to datetime
df['Start Time'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Start Time'], format='%H:%M:%S').dt.time
df['End Time'] = pd.to_datetime(df['End Time'], format='%H:%M:%S').dt.time

# Create a new column for the full start and end datetime
df['Start DateTime'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Dates'].str.split(' - ').str[0] + ' ' + df['Start Time'].astype(str))
df['End DateTime'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Dates'].str.split(' - ').str[0] + ' ' + df['End Time'].astype(str))

# Create the Gantt chart
fig = px.timeline(
    df,
    x_start="Start DateTime",
    x_end="End DateTime",
    y="Course",
    color="Section",
    title="CSE Graduate Program Class Schedule—Spring 2025",
    labels={"Start DateTime": "Start Time", "End DateTime": "End Time"}
)

# Update the layout for better readability
fig.update_layout(
    xaxis_title="Time",
    yaxis_title="Course",
    showlegend=True,
    legend_title="Section"
)

# Show the Gantt chart
fig.show()
```

This code will:
1. Load the CSV file into a DataFrame.
2. Convert the "Start Time" and "End Time" columns to datetime.
3. Create new columns for the full start and end datetime.
4. Create a Gantt chart using `plotly.express.timeline`.
5. Update the layout for better readability and show the Gantt chart.

You can run this code in a Jupyter notebook or any Python environment to visualize the schedule as a Gantt chart.

abhinna1: No, I want the x axis to be time and y axis to be the day of week. MWF is monday wednesday friday and TR is Tuesday, Thursday.

GitHub Copilot: Understood. Let's create a Gantt chart where the x-axis represents the time of day and the y-axis represents the days of the week. We'll need to map the "Days" column to individual days and plot the courses accordingly.

Here's how you can do it:

1. Install the `plotly` library if you haven't already:
   ```bash
   pip install plotly
   ```

2. Use the following code to create the Gantt chart:

```python
import pandas as pd
import plotly.express as px

# Load the CSV file into a DataFrame
df = pd.read_csv('/home/abhinna/ub/Algorithms/HW2/generated_schedule.csv')

# Convert the "Start Time" and "End Time" columns to datetime
df['Start Time'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Start Time'], format='%H:%M:%S').dt.time
df['End Time'] = pd.to_datetime(df['End Time'], format='%H:%M:%S').dt.time

# Map the "Days" column to individual days
day_mapping = {
    'MWF': ['Monday', 'Wednesday', 'Friday'],
    'TR': ['Tuesday', 'Thursday'],
    'R': ['Thursday'],
    'MW': ['Monday', 'Wednesday']
}

# Create a new DataFrame to expand the days
expanded_df = pd.DataFrame()

for index, row in df.iterrows():
    days = day_mapping[row['Days']]
    for day in days:
        new_row = row.copy()
        new_row['Day'] = day
        expanded_df = expanded_df.append(new_row, ignore_index=True)

# Create the Gantt chart
fig = px.timeline(
    expanded_df,
    x_start="Start Time",
    x_end="End Time",
    y="Day",
    color="Course",
    title="CSE Graduate Program Class Schedule—Spring 2025",
    labels={"Start Time": "Start Time", "End Time": "End Time"}
)

# Update the layout for better readability
fig.update_layout(
    xaxis_title="Time",
    yaxis_title="Day of Week",
    showlegend=True,
    legend_title="Course"
)

# Show the Gantt chart
fig.show()
```

This code will:
1. Load the CSV file into a DataFrame.
2. Convert the "Start Time" and "End Time" columns to datetime.
3. Map the "Days" column to individual days.
4. Create a new DataFrame to expand the days.
5. Create a Gantt chart using `plotly.express.timeline`.
6. Update the layout for better readability and show the Gantt chart.

You can run this code in a Jupyter notebook or any Python environment to visualize the schedule as a Gantt chart with the x-axis representing the time of day and the y-axis representing the days of the week.

abhinna1: AttributeError: 'DataFrame' object has no attribute 'append'. Did you mean: '_append'?

GitHub Copilot: The `append` method for DataFrames has been deprecated in recent versions of pandas. You should use the `pd.concat` method instead. Here's the updated code:

```python
import pandas as pd
import plotly.express as px

# Load the CSV file into a DataFrame
df = pd.read_csv('/home/abhinna/ub/Algorithms/HW2/generated_schedule.csv')

# Convert the "Start Time" and "End Time" columns to datetime
df['Start Time'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Start Time'], format='%H:%M:%S').dt.time
df['End Time'] = pd.to_datetime(df['End Time'], format='%H:%M:%S').dt.time

# Map the "Days" column to individual days
day_mapping = {
    'MWF': ['Monday', 'Wednesday', 'Friday'],
    'TR': ['Tuesday', 'Thursday'],
    'R': ['Thursday'],
    'MW': ['Monday', 'Wednesday']
}

# Create a new DataFrame to expand the days
expanded_df_list = []

for index, row in df.iterrows():
    days = day_mapping[row['Days']]
    for day in days:
        new_row = row.copy()
        new_row['Day'] = day
        expanded_df_list.append(new_row)

expanded_df = pd.DataFrame(expanded_df_list)

# Create the Gantt chart
fig = px.timeline(
    expanded_df,
    x_start="Start Time",
    x_end="End Time",
    y="Day",
    color="Course",
    title="CSE Graduate Program Class Schedule—Spring 2025",
    labels={"Start Time": "Start Time", "End Time": "End Time"}
)

# Update the layout for better readability
fig.update_layout(
    xaxis_title="Time",
    yaxis_title="Day of Week",
    showlegend=True,
    legend_title="Course"
)

# Show the Gantt chart
fig.show()
```

This code will:
1. Load the CSV file into a DataFrame.
2. Convert the "Start Time" and "End Time" columns to datetime.
3. Map the "Days" column to individual days.
4. Create a new DataFrame to expand the days using a list and `pd.DataFrame`.
5. Create a Gantt chart using `plotly.express.timeline`.
6. Update the layout for better readability and show the Gantt chart.

You can run this code in your plot.py file to visualize the schedule as a Gantt chart with the x-axis representing the time of day and the y-axis representing the days of the week.

abhinna1: TypeError: Both x_start and x_end must refer to data convertible to datetimes.

GitHub Copilot: The error occurs because `plotly.express.timeline` expects the `x_start` and `x_end` columns to be in datetime format. Since we are dealing with times of the day, we need to convert the `Start Time` and `End Time` columns to datetime objects that include a date.

Here's how you can modify the code to include a dummy date (e.g., January 1, 2025) for the time columns:

```python
import pandas as pd
import plotly.express as px

# Load the CSV file into a DataFrame
df = pd.read_csv('/home/abhinna/ub/Algorithms/HW2/generated_schedule.csv')

# Convert the "Start Time" and "End Time" columns to datetime
df['Start Time'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Start Time'], format='%H:%M:%S').dt.time
df['End Time'] = pd.to_datetime(df['End Time'], format='%H:%M:%S').dt.time

# Map the "Days" column to individual days
day_mapping = {
    'MWF': ['Monday', 'Wednesday', 'Friday'],
    'TR': ['Tuesday', 'Thursday'],
    'R': ['Thursday'],
    'MW': ['Monday', 'Wednesday']
}

# Create a new DataFrame to expand the days
expanded_df_list = []

for index, row in df.iterrows():
    days = day_mapping[row['Days']]
    for day in days:
        new_row = row.copy()
        new_row['Day'] = day
        expanded_df_list.append(new_row)

expanded_df = pd.DataFrame(expanded_df_list)

# Convert "Start Time" and "End Time" to datetime with a dummy date
expanded_df['Start DateTime'] = pd.to_datetime('2025-01-01 ' + expanded_df['Start Time'].astype(str))
expanded_df['End DateTime'] = pd.to_datetime('2025-01-01 ' + expanded_df['End Time'].astype(str))

# Create the Gantt chart
fig = px.timeline(
    expanded_df,
    x_start="Start DateTime",
    x_end="End DateTime",
    y="Day",
    color="Course",
    title="CSE Graduate Program Class Schedule—Spring 2025",
    labels={"Start DateTime": "Start Time", "End DateTime": "End Time"}
)

# Update the layout for better readability
fig.update_layout(
    xaxis_title="Time",
    yaxis_title="Day of Week",
    showlegend=True,
    legend_title="Course"
)

# Show the Gantt chart
fig.show()
```

This code will:
1. Load the CSV file into a DataFrame.
2. Convert the "Start Time" and "End Time" columns to datetime.
3. Map the "Days" column to individual days.
4. Create a new DataFrame to expand the days.
5. Convert the "Start Time" and "End Time" columns to datetime with a dummy date.
6. Create a Gantt chart using `plotly.express.timeline`.
7. Update the layout for better readability and show the Gantt chart.

You can run this code in your plot.py file to visualize the schedule as a Gantt chart with the x-axis representing the time of day and the y-axis representing the days of the week.

abhinna1: lgtm, can we also sequence the y axis serially monday to friday?

GitHub Copilot: Sure, you can sequence the y-axis to display the days of the week in order from Monday to Friday. You can achieve this by setting the category order for the y-axis in the `update_layout` method.

Here's the updated code:

```python
import pandas as pd
import plotly.express as px

# Load the CSV file into a DataFrame
df = pd.read_csv('/home/abhinna/ub/Algorithms/HW2/generated_schedule.csv')

# Convert the "Start Time" and "End Time" columns to datetime
df['Start Time'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Start Time'], format='%H:%M:%S').dt.time
df['End Time'] = pd.to_datetime(df['End Time'], format='%H:%M:%S').dt.time

# Map the "Days" column to individual days
day_mapping = {
    'MWF': ['Monday', 'Wednesday', 'Friday'],
    'TR': ['Tuesday', 'Thursday'],
    'R': ['Thursday'],
    'MW': ['Monday', 'Wednesday']
}

# Create a new DataFrame to expand the days
expanded_df_list = []

for index, row in df.iterrows():
    days = day_mapping[row['Days']]
    for day in days:
        new_row = row.copy()
        new_row['Day'] = day
        expanded_df_list.append(new_row)

expanded_df = pd.DataFrame(expanded_df_list)

# Convert "Start Time" and "End Time" to datetime with a dummy date
expanded_df['Start DateTime'] = pd.to_datetime('2025-01-01 ' + expanded_df['Start Time'].astype(str))
expanded_df['End DateTime'] = pd.to_datetime('2025-01-01 ' + expanded_df['End Time'].astype(str))

# Create the Gantt chart
fig = px.timeline(
    expanded_df,
    x_start="Start DateTime",
    x_end="End DateTime",
    y="Day",
    color="Course",
    title="CSE Graduate Program Class Schedule—Spring 2025",
    labels={"Start DateTime": "Start Time", "End DateTime": "End Time"}
)

# Update the layout for better readability and sequence the y-axis
fig.update_layout(
    xaxis_title="Time",
    yaxis_title="Day of Week",
    yaxis=dict(categoryorder='array', categoryarray=['Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday']),
    showlegend=True,
    legend_title="Course"
)

# Show the Gantt chart
fig.show()
```

This code will:
1. Load the CSV file into a DataFrame.
2. Convert the "Start Time" and "End Time" columns to datetime.

8. Show the Gantt chart.

You can run this code in your plot.py file to visualize the schedule as a Gantt chart with the x-axis representing the time of day and the y-axis representing the days of the week in the correct order.

abhinna1: and inside each course in the gantt can we have text that says cource name and starttime-endtime?

GitHub Copilot: Yes, you can add text inside each course in the Gantt chart to display the course name and start time-end time. You can achieve this by using the `text` parameter in the `px.timeline` function.

Here's the updated code:

```python
import pandas as pd
import plotly.express as px

# Load the CSV file into a DataFrame
df = pd.read_csv('/home/abhinna/ub/Algorithms/HW2/generated_schedule.csv')

# Convert the "Start Time" and "End Time" columns to datetime
df['Start Time'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Start Time'], format='%H:%M:%S').dt.time
df['End Time'] = pd.to_datetime(df['End Time'], format='%H:%M:%S').dt.time

# Map the "Days" column to individual days
day_mapping = {
    'MWF': ['Monday', 'Wednesday', 'Friday'],
    'TR': ['Tuesday', 'Thursday'],
    'R': ['Thursday'],
    'MW': ['Monday', 'Wednesday']
}

# Create a new DataFrame to expand the days
expanded_df_list = []

for index, row in df.iterrows():
    days = day_mapping[row['Days']]
    for day in days:
        new_row = row.copy()
        new_row['Day'] = day
        expanded_df_list.append(new_row)

expanded_df = pd.DataFrame(expanded_df_list)

# Convert "Start Time" and "End Time" to datetime with a dummy date
expanded_df['Start DateTime'] = pd.to_datetime('2025-01-01 ' + expanded_df['Start Time'].astype(str))
expanded_df['End DateTime'] = pd.to_datetime('2025-01-01 ' + expanded_df['End Time'].astype(str))

# Create a text column for the Gantt chart
expanded_df['Text'] = expanded_df['Course'] + ': ' + expanded_df['Start Time'].astype(str) + '-' + expanded_df['End Time'].astype(str)

# Create the Gantt chart
fig = px.timeline(
    expanded_df,
    x_start="Start DateTime",
    x_end="End DateTime",
    y="Day",
    color="Course",
    text="Text",
    title="CSE Graduate Program Class Schedule—Spring 2025",
    labels={"Start DateTime": "Start Time", "End DateTime": "End Time"}
)

# Update the layout for better readability and sequence the y-axis
fig.update_layout(
    xaxis_title="Time",
    yaxis_title="Day of Week",
    yaxis=dict(categoryorder='array', categoryarray=['Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday']),
    showlegend=True,
    legend_title="Course"
)

# Show the Gantt chart

```

This code will:
1. Load the CSV file into a DataFrame.
2. Convert the "Start Time" and "End Time" columns to datetime.
3. Map the "Days" column to individual days.
4. Create a new DataFrame to expand the days.
5. Convert the "Start Time" and "End Time" columns to datetime with a dummy date.
6. Create a text column that combines the course name and start time-end time.
7. Create a Gantt chart using `plotly.express.timeline` with the `text` parameter.
8. Update the layout for better readability and sequence the y-axis to display the days of the week in order from Monday to Friday.
9. Show the Gantt chart.

You can run this code in your plot.py file to visualize the schedule as a Gantt chart with the x-axis representing the time of day, the y-axis representing the days of the week, and text inside each course displaying the course name and start time-end time.

abhinna1: nevermind, instead of inside, can we have legends indicate the class timings?

GitHub Copilot: Sure, you can include the class timings in the legend by modifying the `color` parameter to include both the course name and the class timings. This way, the legend will display the course name along with the start and end times.

Here's how you can do it:

```python
import pandas as pd
import plotly.express as px

# Load the CSV file into a DataFrame
df = pd.read_csv('/home/abhinna/ub/Algorithms/HW2/generated_schedule.csv')

# Convert the "Start Time" and "End Time" columns to datetime

df['End Time'] = pd.to_datetime(df['End Time'], format='%H:%M:%S').dt.time

# Map the "Days" column to individual days
day_mapping = {
    'MWF': ['Monday', 'Wednesday', 'Friday'],
    'TR': ['Tuesday', 'Thursday'],
    'R': ['Thursday'],
    'MW': ['Monday', 'Wednesday']
}

# Create a new DataFrame to expand the days
expanded_df_list = []

for index, row in df.iterrows():
    days = day_mapping[row['Days']]
    for day in days:
        new_row = row.copy()
        new_row['Day'] = day
        expanded_df_list.append(new_row)

expanded_df = pd.DataFrame(expanded_df_list)

# Convert "Start Time" and "End Time" to datetime with a dummy date
expanded_df['Start DateTime'] = pd.to_datetime('2025-01-01 ' + expanded_df['Start Time'].astype(str))
expanded_df['End DateTime'] = pd.to_datetime('2025-01-01 ' + expanded_df['End Time'].astype(str))

# Create a new column for the legend that includes the course name and timings
expanded_df['Course_Timing'] = expanded_df['Course'] + ': ' + expanded_df['Start Time'].astype(str) + '-' + expanded_df['End Time'].astype(str)

# Create the Gantt chart
fig = px.timeline(
    expanded_df,
    x_start="Start DateTime",
    x_end="End DateTime",
    y="Day",
    color="Course_Timing",
    title="CSE Graduate Program Class Schedule—Spring 2025",
    labels={"Start DateTime": "Start Time", "End DateTime": "End Time"}
)

# Update the layout for better readability and sequence the y-axis
fig.update_layout(
    xaxis_title="Time",
    yaxis_title="Day of Week",
    yaxis=dict(categoryorder='array', categoryarray=['Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday']),
    showlegend=True,
    legend_title="Course and Timings"
)

# Show the Gantt chart
fig.show()
```

This code will:
1. Load the CSV file into a DataFrame.
2. Convert the "Start Time" and "End Time" columns to datetime.
3. Map the "Days" column to individual days.
4. Create a new DataFrame to expand the days.
5. Convert the "Start Time" and "End Time" columns to datetime with a dummy date.
